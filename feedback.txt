Project feedback and mark details

Correctness and adherence to specification:  30  (out of 30%)

- At the very last line of three_musketeers.py, consider modifying your code as follows to ensure your code runs as submitted (whilst also running without modification in pytest). 

    if __name__ == “__main__”:
        start()

- Your functionality works as specified. Well Done!

Completeness of code, tests, and commit history:  30    (out of 30%)   

- Your implementation is complete.
- Your 20 tests all pass. Your number of tests is appropriate for the project.
- GitHub session 7 initial commit is present.
- Your GitHub commit history is good.

Coding style: 9   (out of 10%) 

- Your coding style is overall good. Consider removing lines of code you have commented out from your final version that you submit (e.g. lines 158/159).


Extension:  26     (out of 30%) 

- You have implemented the file saving extension which works correctly. You could also consider adding functionality to allow multiple games to be saved (perhaps by specifying the filename). Consider allowing the program to be exited other than on completion of the program (or externally terminating it) to allow the program to be restarted cleanly with the saved game.
