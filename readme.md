    <h1>Three Musketeers Game</h1>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>Players take turns moving one piece.The Musketeer starts.</p>
    <ul>
	<li>The Musketeer can move up, down, left , right and not diagonally. The Musketeer can only move
		to a space occupied by an enemy.</li>
	<li>The enemy can move to any non-diagonal adjecent empty space.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The enemy wins if it force all 3 Musketeers to be on the same row or column.</p>
    <p>The musketeers win if on their turn they cannot move due to there being no enemy pieces adjacent
       to any musketeer and they are not all on the same row or column. As long as one musketeer can move, the game is not won.</p>   
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>This game must be played on an IDE. I recommend you either download IDLE or PyCharm to play the game.</p>
    <p>There are 2 files that play the game, 'three_musketeers' and 'three_muskteers_with_files'. The latter automatically saves the game after every move.</p>
    <p>To start a game, type in start(). You should then be given the option to either play as a Musketeer(M) or an Enemy(R).</p>
    <p>Once you have selected what to play as, a board should appear along with instructions on how to move your piece.</p>
    <p>If you are playing on the 'three_musketeers_with_files' file, then you can kill the program at any time and, if you want, continue to play from where you left when you start another game</p>
